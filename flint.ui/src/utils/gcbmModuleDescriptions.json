  "CBMDecayModule": "This module calculates the annual decay and turnover on a set of dead organic matter pools present in the GCBM. Data requirements for the Decay Module are:\n 1. A table named \"decay_parameters\", with one set of decay parameters for each of the enumerated dom pools in the DomPool.\n 2. Scalar \"mean_annual_temperature\". This is the mean annual temperature of the environment.\n 3. Scalar \"SlowMixingRate\". This is the amount that has moved from slow aboveground to slow belowground annually.",
