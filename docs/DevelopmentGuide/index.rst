Development Guide
=================

This documentation is an entry level guide into the architectural
disposition of the FLINT UI. Its role is to show the building blocks of
the FLINT UI and the rationale behind it. More technical explanations of
the source code should be found within the source directory of FLINT UI.

This documentation is strongly related to a series of guides detailing
how to :ref:`set up <installation>` and operate the FLINT UI and develop
further on the same. We recommend that you have a look at them as well for
a more fuller understanding of the domain.
